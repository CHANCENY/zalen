 *   - by-{entity-type}-author: Reservation by the author of the parent entity,
 *     eg. by-node-author.
 *   - preview: When previewing a new or edited reservation.
 *   The following applies only to viewers who are registered users:
 *   - unpublished: An unpublished reservation visible only to administrators.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - content_attributes: List of classes for the styling of the reservation content.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - threaded: A flag indicating whether the reservations are threaded or not.

 *   visually-hidden.

 * - reservation: Full reservation object.
 * - entity: Entity the reservations are attached to.
